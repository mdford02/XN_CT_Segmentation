# Hemorrhage CT Image Segmentation and Classification

### Code and Graphics are organized as follows:

### Logistic Regression
- log_reg_confusion_matrix.ipynb contains code to implement logistic regression on standard image data
- log_reg_with_segments.ipynb contains code to implement logistic regression on image data and segmented pixel masks
- log_reg_segment_cm.JPG contains the confusion matrix generated by an iteration of log_reg_with_segments.ipynb that cut out some Intraventricular images to reduce bias
- Log_Segments_CM.jpg contains the confusion matrix of the logistic regression model generated with all of the labeled segmentation data

### Neural Networks
- nn_model_[window type].ipynb contains code to implement a neural network trained on the respective CT scan window type

### Segmentation
- segmentation.py contains the implementation of the segmentation model. The saved model can be found in hemorrhage_segmentation/
- segmentation_epochs.png contains information on the training and validation accuracy and loss of the final segmentation model
- model_prediction.png contains an example pixel mask prediction of the final model
- model_train_val_loss.png contains a graphic of the training and validation loss of the final segmentation model

### Other
- XN_CT_SEGMENTATION.ipynb contains initial data visualization after first downloading
- loag_image_data.py contains some functions to assist in image processing
